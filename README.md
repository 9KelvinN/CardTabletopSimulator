For Kelvin, Venkat, and AJ
Welcome to Python Card Simulator v4.0
This is an advanced card simulator that allows users to drag and drop cards around a table, and have the cards interact with different predefined areas.

--FEATURES--

It comes with some pretty nifty features including:
1. Spacebar to auto deal
2. Right click to select multiple cards at a time
3. Esc to quit
4. Many themes to choose from
5. Variable number of players
6. Toggle for jokers
7. Sweet start up menu
8. A beautiful, easy to use UI
9. Readable code
11. Turn based play (use number keys 1 through 4)

This program was built on Windows using python 3.7 and pygame 1.9.1.

--REQUIREMENTS--

run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The breakdown:
1. AJ: Created the GUI and created a very well developed prototype with card placement, motion, card flipping, and defined areas.
2. Kelvin: Refined and improved code, integrated separate classes together, created discard pile, introduced sorting to each hand area, enhanced functionality with less than four players.
3. Venkat: Created the menu GUI that accepts input from user, created BUTTONS in pygame (very arduous).
