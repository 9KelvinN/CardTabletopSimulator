# Python-Proj
For Kelvin, Venkat, and AJ
Welcome to Python Card Simulator v4.0
This is an advanced card simulator that allows users to drag and drop cards around a table, and have the cards interact with different predefined areas.

--FEATURES--

It comes with some pretty nifty features including:
1. Spacebar to auto deal
2. Right click to select multiple cards at a time
3. Esc to quit
4. many themes to choose from
5. variable number of players
6. toggle for jokers
7. sweet start up menu
8. A beautiful, easy to use UI
9. Readable code
11. Turn based play (use numkeys 1 through 4)

This program was built on Windows using python 3.7 and pygame 1.9.1.

--REQUIREMENTS--

In order to compile this you will need to install pyGame, and already have the latest verion of python3 installed.
- If on Windows
1. Go to Command Prompt on windows by typing win+r, then "cmd", enter
2. Type in the following command "py -m pip install --user pygame"
3. Click "Y" if prompted.
4. Download the zip file from github, and run in a virtual Environment.
- If on Linux or Mac and have pip
1. Open terminal
2. Enter "python3 -m pip install pygame"
   
The basic instructions are included in the features above.

The breakdown:
1. AJ: Created the GUI and created a very well developed prototype with card placement, motion, card flipping, and defined areas.
2. Kelvin: Refined and improved code, integrated separate classes together, created discard pile, introduced sorting to each hand area, enhanced functionality with less than four players.
3. Venkat: Created the menu GUI that accepts input from user, created BUTTONS in pygame (very arduous).
